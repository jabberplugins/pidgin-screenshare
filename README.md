This is the official source code for the ScreenShareOTR plugin as seen on https://pidgin.im/plugins?query=ssotr

In its current state, this plugin has been fully tested on Windows XP - 11 & Linux (Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu)

The plugin uses a reverse-tunneling expressjs server on https://jabberplugins.net (hosted by me) for routing OTR-encrypted (if enabled) screenshare packets between you & your buddy.
You can select which window you wish to share OR you can also share the entire desktop.

If you find any bugs or want to make some contributions to the plugin feel free to open a pull request
